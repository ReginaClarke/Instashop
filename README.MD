### Description

This application is a social media application focused on users sharing their photos with users they approve. The galleries created will be shopable. A customer can select an item within the photo and be redirected to a website for purchase.

Customers can purchase from a range of categories to shop from while sellers can create an account which can include B2B and B2C with B2C being public.

Link to deployed site: TBD

#

##### MVP

- Create users and relationships (B2B relationships)
- Lead customer to checkout
- Create a visually appealing website that keeps the user in the application longer

##### Post-MVP

- Improve Mobile view to align with competition quality. This will be additional styling.

### Expected Challenges

Creating all parts of the application which allows the user to fully understand the point of the application while still fully understanding each line of code. My goal is to use comments mindfully to ensure I can overcome this.

I get hung up on connecting the front-end to the back-end, so I expect to spend more time reviewing this material.

Managing state efficiently is something I'm working on, so I intent on spending time reviewing this.

My plan of action to overcome this is to scale back where necessary to ensure my full understanding of all parts I develop for the final project. I will expand during post-mvp where needed.

### You will need the following in your README when you submit your final product (due 4/14)

- Installation instructions (is this for the user or for the technical person?)

- Helper Functions - Helper functions should be generic enough that they can be reused in other applications

      	| Function | Description |
      	| --- | :---: |
      	| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text |

- Code - Include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description

      	```
      	function reverse(string) {
      		// here is the code to reverse a string of text
      	}
      	```

- Issues and Resolutions - Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution
